Below mentioned are the links to download the dataset. Because of the huge traffic, some of the links might not work. Download the dataset from the link which works for you.
Link 1 - data.csv 🤯
Link 2 - data.csv 🙄
Link 3 - data.csv 😐
Link 4 - data.csv 😶
Link 5 - data.csv 😪

Step - 2: Train different Machine Learning models:
Logistic Regression
SVM with Linear Kernel
SVM with RBF Kernel
Decision Tree
KNN

Step - 3: Perform proper hyperparameter tuning for each model from Step - 2 😢
Step - 4: Compare all the models and write your observations i.e. why is one model better than the other?
Add this observation at the end of your jupyter notebook
Hint: Try to visualise the data 😮

Step - 5: Upload your Jupyter Notebook on Github or Google Drive and submit the link in the form mentioned below.
